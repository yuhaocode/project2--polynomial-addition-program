The executable will consume two filenames from the command line and will print to stdout the sum of the two polynomials found in those files. These polynomials will be stored in the following format: 5 9 8 7 6 5 represents 9*x^4 + 8*x^3 + 7*x^2 + 6*x^1 + 5. More formally there will be a single line which begins with an integer that represents the length of the polynomial (the degree plus 1) followed by white-space then white-space separated coefficients in descending order. The program expects the highest-degree term to be non-zero. Example: 3 1 0 2 plus 5 1 0 0 1 2 should display to screen 5 1 0 1 1 4. Add a third argument which gives you a modulus so that the arithmetic is mod that modulus. Adjust the length of the output based on the NEW length of the polynomial. Do this with multiplication too.
